# michess ♟️

An open-source NFC-based smart chess board powered by a Raspberry Pi. Place any piece on any square and the board knows exactly what it is and where it is — no setup routine, no special starting position required.

The board uses LEDs embedded behind a wood veneer to indicate the chess engine's moves, creating a clean physical interface for playing against a computer opponent.

## Features

- **Full piece identification** — NFC tags in each piece base, detected by a matrix of antennas under the board
- **Arbitrary position recognition** — pick up mid-game, set up a puzzle, analyse a position
- **LED move indicators** — subtle lighting behind the veneer shows the engine's chosen move
- **Stockfish integration** — plays via the standard UCI chess engine interface
- **Open design** — all hardware designs and software are freely available

## How It Works

64 NFC antennas sit beneath the board, one per square, managed by a hierarchical multiplexer system. A Raspberry Pi 4 scans the full board in under 2 seconds, determines the game state, passes it to Stockfish, and lights up the appropriate squares.

See [`docs/architecture/`](docs/architecture/) for full system diagrams.
