# st25r-reader-tester

Bring-up harness for the Elechouse **ST25R3916B MINI** reader on a Raspberry Pi. This is step 1 of the 4-square prototype plan: prove the reader, SPI link, IRQ line and driver work using only the stock hardware, so any later failure can only be caused by the custom hardware (coils, mux).

## Running it again

- Check you're on the right branch: `git branch --show-current` should print `feature/1-prototype-reading-a-single-nfc-tag`.
- In `development/st25r-reader-tester`, run `uv run id_check.py`. Expect `ID=0x31 type=6`.
- From `vendor/ST25R3916_v2.8.0_Linux_demo_v1.0/linux_demo/build`, run `sudo ./demo/nfc_demo_st25r3916b` to keep the stock antenna active. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it; stop it before swapping antennas.
- `vendor/` is git-ignored, so after a fresh clone you need the unpack, edit and build steps later in this document before the demo will run.

## Status (28 Sep 2026)

| Goal | Result |
|---|---|
| 5V safety check on signal lines | ✅ Pass |
| Chip ID over SPI (Python) | ✅ `type=6` (ST25R3916B) |
| ST RFAL driver builds and runs on Trixie | ✅ |
| Read an NTAG213 tag | ✅ |
| Baseline read distance (stock antenna) | ✅ ~31 mm |
| Does the MINI have AAT varicaps? | ✅ No — fixed matching network, AAT_A/AAT_B unconnected |

## Hardware setup

- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.5, Debian 13 (trixie)
- Connected via a GPIO extension board (T-cobbler) on a breadboard. This is fine for SPI; the breadboard only matters for antenna leads at 13.56 MHz.
- Reader: ST25R3916B MINI with its bundled 52 × 5.5 mm antenna (10 cm cable)

### Wiring

⚠️ The cable colours do **not** follow the usual convention. Red is IRQ, not 5V. Black is CS, not GND. Wire by label, not by colour.

| Wire | Module signal | Pi (cobbler label) | Physical pin |
|---|---|---|---|
| Red | IRQ | GPIO25 | 22 |
| Black | CS | CE0 (GPIO8) | 24 |
| Yellow | SCLK | SCLK (GPIO11) | 23 |
| Green | MOSI | MOSI (GPIO10) | 19 |
| Blue | MISO | MISO (GPIO9) | 21 |
| White | 5V | 5V | 2 |
| Orange | GND | GND | 6 |

IRQ is on **GPIO25**, not GPIO7 as in ST's instructions. GPIO7 is the Pi's second SPI chip-select (CE1), which the SPI driver claims (`/dev/spidev0.1`).

### 5V safety check

The module takes a 5V supply, and the Pi's GPIO pins are not 5V tolerant. So, before connecting any signal wires, the module was powered with only 5V and GND connected, and each signal wire was measured against GND.

| Wire | Reading |
|---|---|
| White (5V) | 5.07 V |
| Red (IRQ) | 0 V |
| Black (CS) | 0.56 V |
| Yellow (SCLK) | 0 V |
| Green (MOSI) | 0.50 V |
| Blue (MISO) | 0 V |

All signal lines were well under 3.3V. Pass.

## Chip ID check (Python)

This is a uv project with `spidev` as its only dependency. SPI must be enabled first (`sudo raspi-config nonint do_spi 0`, then reboot).

```
uv run id_check.py
```

Result: `ID=0x31 type=6 rev=1`. Type 6 means ST25R3916B. `0x00` or `0xFF` would indicate a wiring problem.

## ST RFAL driver (C)

- Source: ST **STSW-ST25R013** from st.com (free account needed), which unpacks to `ST25R3916_v2.8.0_Linux_demo_v1.0`
- It lives in `vendor/`, which is **git-ignored**. ST's licence may not allow redistribution, so re-download it rather than committing it.
- The download file lost its `.tar` extension. To unpack: `unxz STSW-ST25R013.xz`, then `tar -xvf STSW-ST25R013 -C vendor/`

### Local modification (lost on re-extract, so re-apply it)

`linux_demo/platform/st25r3916b/rfal_platform.h`, line 126:

```
#define ST25R_INT_PIN   7   →   25
```

### Build

```
cd vendor/ST25R3916_v2.8.0_Linux_demo_v1.0/linux_demo
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DRFAL_VARIANT=st25r3916b ..
make
```

Gotcha: without the leading `-` on `-D`, CMake silently ignores the setting and builds the **non-B** variant. That build uses the unedited header, so IRQ ends up back on GPIO7. Check that cmake prints `Building st25r3916b Reader/Writer demo`. If you rebuild, delete `build/` first, because CMake caches old settings.

Harmless warnings: the CMake deprecation notice, and a pointer-to-int cast in `rfal_isoDep.c`. The cast is in card-emulation code, which we don't use.

### Run

```
sudo ./demo/nfc_demo_st25r3916b
```

Output with a tag on the antenna:

```
ISO14443A/NFC-A card found. UID: 538D0400A40001
 Read Block: OK Data: 538D045200A40001A5480000E1101200
```

The driver worked on Trixie without changes, apart from the IRQ pin.

## Baseline read distance

| Setup | Result |
|---|---|
| NTAG213 25 mm sticker, flat on the bundled 52 × 5.5 mm antenna, lifted straight up until reads stop | **~31 mm** |

This is the reference for comparing custom coils in bring-up step 4. Elechouse quote ~5 cm with a full-size card, so ~31 mm with a small sticker is in line.

Note: the tag's data block (`E1 10 12 00`) confirms an NDEF-formatted tag with NTAG213 memory size. However, genuine NXP UIDs usually start with `04`, and this one starts with `53`, so it may be a compatible chip from another maker. That's fine for now, but worth remembering if tag performance seems inconsistent.

## AAT status

Elechouse confirmed in early Oct 2026 that the MINI does not have varicaps. The AAT_A and AAT_B pins are unconnected, and the board uses a fixed matching network designed for the bundled ~700 nH antenna. They also do not publish a schematic for the MINI.

- **28 Sep 2026:** emailed Elechouse asking whether the MINI has varicaps, for the MINI schematic, and for the antenna inductance the matching network is designed for.
- **Early Oct 2026:** Elechouse confirmed that the MINI has no varicaps, that AAT_A/AAT_B are unconnected, that the matching network is fixed for the bundled ~700 nH antenna, and that no published schematic is available.

The next step is not to try to set AAT registers and look for a change. Instead, every custom coil should be wound to behave like the stock antenna, and the chip's amplitude/phase measurement should be used as a fingerprint. We will record the stock antenna's amplitude and phase as the reference, then compare each custom coil against that baseline. RFAL may expose helpers such as `rfalChipMeasureAmplitude` and `rfalChipMeasurePhase`, but these are still unverified until checked in the vendor headers.

- **Next step (1 h):** record the stock antenna's amplitude and phase as the reference.
